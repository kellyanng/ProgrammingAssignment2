## These functions cache the inverse of a matrix to allow faster access 
## when the inverse of the matrix is needed repeatedly

## Creates a list that can cache the inverse of a matrix once calculated
makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
    m <- NULL

    getsolve <- function() m
    list(set = set, get = get,
         setsolve = setsolve,
         getsolve = getsolve)
}


## Returns the inverse of a matrix. If the matrix inverse has already been found
## it will returned the cached value instead of recalculating

        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
